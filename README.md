# Spam-Detection
Spam detection on preprocessed email data

## Overview
In this project, I use seven different models: Decision Tree, Linear/Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, XGBoost, LightGBM and Neural Network to perform the same spam prediction using two kinds of objectives: model accuracy and business cost.
Because of the imbalance distribution of targeted binary variable, both the two types of prediction models are modified using the class weights.
